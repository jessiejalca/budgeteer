# Budgeteer

A [simple budget calculator tool](https://jessiejalca.github.io/budgeteer/) to help with envelope budgeting calculations. Figure out how much you need to save per week, every other week, or month to reach your savings goal by a certain date. Or see how long it'll take you to reach a goal based on a scheduled funding amount.
